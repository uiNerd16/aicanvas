--- LAYOUT ---
7 health-metric cards arranged as a rotating flower. All cards share a single anchor at the canvas centre. Each card pivots from its bottom-left corner (transform-origin: 0% 100%), extends upward from the anchor, and is rotated by its hand-tuned slot angle so the bouquet fans out organically.

SLOT_ANGLES (degrees): [-35.55, 22.14, 71.01, 122.25, 161.58, -150.4, -108.41]

Stage size: clamp(300px, 50vw, 560px), centred in a min-h-screen container.
Card dimensions: 240 × 138 px.

--- IDLE ANIMATION ---
A single shared useMotionValue<number> (degrees) advances in useAnimationFrame at 360/45 deg/s (one revolution per 45 s), mod-clamped to [0,360). Each card's pivot div receives a rotate(\${slotAngle + idleRotation}deg) transform via a useMotionValueEvent listener (FOLLOW mode — no spring lag).

--- CARD VISUAL ---
Each card is a two-layer structure:
  Outer shell: linear-gradient top→bottom from PASTEL to GRADIENT_END, border-radius 24px, no border. Box shadow: -8px 16px 32px rgba(0,0,0,0.12), -3px 6px 14px rgba(0,0,0,0.18).
  Padding: 12px 4px 4px 4px. Gap: 10px. Font: Manrope.

  Header row: Phosphor icon (14px, weight="regular", color=DARK) + title text (12px, weight 500, #1a1a1a). 8px gap, 6px left padding.

  Inner panel: background #f7f7f5, border-radius 20px, padding 12px, inner shadow 0px 1px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.25). Two rows:
    Top: pill (right-aligned) — background DARK, white text 10px semibold, padding 5px 10px, border-radius 999px.
    Bottom: left side has LABEL (10px, 600, #1a1a1a, letter-spacing 0.48px) above VALUE (23px, 600, color=DARK, letter-spacing -0.28px). Right side has a 54×36 sparkline SVG.

Sparkline: 4-point Catmull-Rom cubic bezier curve (smooth, no kinks). Area fill with linearGradient (DARK at 12% opacity top → 0% bottom). Stroke: DARK, 1.5px, round caps/joins. No end dot.

engagedIndex: number | null — single useState in parent.
topIndex: number | null — tracks last-clicked card for persistent z-order.

Click a card: it glides to the canvas centre, lifts forward (translateZ 120px), scales to 1.18×. Click again or tap outside to release.

Per-card springs:
  centeringFactor (0→1): LIFT_SPRING {stiffness:140, damping:28, mass:1}
  lift (0→120): LIFT_SPRING
  scale (1→1.18): LIFT_SPRING

Card body transform: translate(\${-50*cf}%, calc(-50% - (50%)*(1-cf))) — interpolates from bottom-left slot to centred on anchor as centeringFactor goes 0→1.

--- ROTATION: SHORTEST PATH ---
Each card tracks a per-card cardRotation MotionValue with two modes:
  FOLLOW mode (non-engaged): cardRotation = SLOT_ANGLES[i] + idleRotation, updated by useMotionValueEvent listener.
  SPRING mode (engagement transitions): for engaging → spring cardRotation to 0 via animate() with LIFT_SPRING. For releasing → instantly set cardRotation = SLOT_ANGLES[i] + idleRotation (invisible while card is centred on pivot), immediately re-enable FOLLOW mode.
  Use shortestEquivalent(current, target) to clamp spring arc to ≤180°.

--- Z-INDEX ---
  useTransform(lift, z => z > 4 ? 50 : engaged ? 40 : isTop ? 30 : 1)
  Nudge lift.set(lift.get()) on engaged/isTop change to force recompute.

--- DUAL THEME ---
  import useTheme from ThemeProvider.
  Dark bg: #1A1A19. Light bg: #F0F0E8.
  Card visuals (gradients, panel) are self-contained — no theme switching needed inside cards.

--- REDUCED MOTION ---
