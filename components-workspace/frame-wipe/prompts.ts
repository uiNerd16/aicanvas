    div  className="absolute inset-0 isolate"
      img  src={PHOTOS[0].src}  alt={PHOTOS[0].alt}  className="absolute inset-0 h-full w-full object-cover"  draggable={false}
      FrameTitle  title={PHOTOS[0].title}
    PhotoLayer  key={step.photo.src}  step={step}  progress={scrollYProgress}  reduceMotion={shouldReduceMotion}  [map WIPE_SEQUENCE.map((step) => ...)]

        span  className="text-[12px] font-semibold uppercase tracking-[0.18em]"  > Selected Works
        span  className="text-[12px] uppercase tracking-[0.18em]"  > Concrete and Light
      div  className="absolute right-4 top-4 text-[12px] font-semibold uppercase tracking-[0.18em] md:right-8 md:top-8"

          CaretDown  size={16}  weight="regular"

The separator span's children are literally a leading space, a slash, a space, then {TOTAL_LABEL},
so the readout renders as "01 / 05". The h2 is the only real heading: the visible titles are
aria-hidden duplicates, and h2 not h1 because this is a section pasted into someone else's page.

The root already ships min-h-screen and it must stay: a standalone paste needs it, or an ancestor
with a real height, or the root collapses and takes its absolute layers with it. The scroll length
is the inline height: SECTION_HEIGHT, and the sticky panel's height is the panelHeight MotionValue
in px, never 100% and never 100vh once the scroller has been measured.

### PhotoLayer({ step, progress, reduceMotion }: { step: WipeStep; progress: MotionValue<number>; reduceMotion: boolean })

    ease: ENTER_EASE,

  FrameTitle  title={step.photo.title}  enter={reduceMotion ? undefined : enter}  direction={step.direction}

### FrameTitle({ title, enter, direction }: { title: string; enter?: MotionValue<number>; direction?: Direction })

  // \`enter\` is absent for the frame that is already on screen at rest, and
  // whenever the viewer asked for reduced motion: the title just sits settled.
  const atRest = useMotionValue(1)
  const arrival = enter ?? atRest
  const from = direction ? ENTER_FROM[direction] : null

  )
  const letterSpacing = useTransform(tracking, (value) => \`\${value}em\`)

  // optically centred while it tightens.
  const trailing = useTransform(tracking, (value) => \`\${-value}em\`)
  const offset = useTransform(
    arrival,
    [0, 1],
    [from ? ENTER_OFFSET * from.sign : 0, 0],
  )

motion.span  aria-hidden="true"  className="pointer-events-none absolute inset-0 z-10 flex flex-col items-center justify-center p-4 text-center font-extrabold uppercase leading-none text-[#FFFFFF] dark:text-[#FFFFFF] md:p-8"  style={{ fontSize: 'clamp(32px, 14vw, 160px)', letterSpacing, mixBlendMode: 'difference', x: from?.axis === 'x' ? offset : 0, y: from?.axis === 'y' ? offset : 0 }}

## 5. Why

- Every inset() slot carries an explicit percentage, including the zeros. Framer Motion cannot interpolate an inset() that mixes unitless 0 with 0%: it emits an invalid value, the browser falls back to clip-path: none, and the layer sits fully revealed from the first frame instead of wiping.
- The title is nested INSIDE its own photo layer, never in a shared layer above the stack. Text has a transparent background, so a shared layer lets every title pile up on screen at once; nested, the next opaque photo covers the previous title for free and exactly one title is ever visible. isolate on each layer scopes the difference blend to its own photo.
- One word per line, stacked, instead of a natural wrap. The animated letter spacing changes the measured text width, so a short title reflowed from two lines to one halfway through its own cut. Stacking makes the line count a property of the copy, not of the current tracking or viewport width.
- Progress comes from the wrapper's own getBoundingClientRect against the nearest REAL scroll container, not from Framer Motion's container option, which requires the scrolling ancestor to be non-static. The container walk requires scrollHeight > clientHeight as well as overflowY auto or scroll, because body { overflow-x: hidden } computes overflowY to auto on half the pages this gets pasted into.
- Listeners go on BOTH the found container and window, always. Scroll events do not bubble from an inner scroller up to window, so the container alone misses a plain page and window alone misses an app shell that scrolls an inner div. Reads are coalesced into one requestAnimationFrame.
- The sticky panel sizes off the measured scroller, not 100vh. Inside a shell with a fixed header, or on iOS where 100vh is the large viewport, a 100vh panel hangs below the visible area and clips its own bottom chrome. viewportHeight starts at 0 meaning "not measured", which falls back to '100vh' so the server render and first client render agree.
- Each title's arrival is driven by its OWN frame's scroll window, from step.from to step.settled, which runs 45% of the wipe's length past the wipe. An earlier version ticked one shared spacing value on every cut, which twitched every title at once including the ones nothing was happening to.
- Reduced motion swaps the interpolated clip for a hard snap at (from + to) / 2, drops the enter MotionValue so no title slides or tracks in, and drops the caret's y keyframes. Nothing is hidden, only the movement is removed.

## 6. Remix

- Pace: SECTION_HEIGHT ('1100vh') is the whole timeline, so raising it slows everything without changing the rhythm. Inside each equal slice, the 0.18 and 0.72 fractions in WIPE_SEQUENCE set how long the frame holds still before and after its cut, and the 0.45 multiplier on settled sets how far past the wipe the type keeps moving.
- Type arrival: ENTER_TRACKING (0.16em) to SETTLED_TRACKING (0.02em) is the tightening, ENTER_OFFSET (48px) is the slide distance, ENTER_EASE (cubicBezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)) is its curve, and ENTER_FROM decides which axis and sign each direction pushes along. Keep the sign WITH the wipe or the type and the reveal stop reading as one gesture.
- Content and palette: swap PHOTOS for your own five landscape images with alt text and a short two-word title each, then retune DIRECTIONS if you want a different cut order (it cycles down, right, up, left across HIDDEN_CLIP). The surface is #0A0A0A and every piece of type is #FFFFFF on mixBlendMode difference, so a lighter background needs both changed together.

## 7. Check

A line that fails is a bug in your build; fix it and re-check.
- A naked paste fills the viewport: the root keeps min-h-screen next to its inline height: SECTION_HEIGHT, the sticky panel gets a px height from panelHeight, and nothing collapses to zero.
- Every hex value and every key expression appears unchanged from block 2: #0A0A0A and #FFFFFF, key={step.photo.src} and key={\`\${word}-\${index}\`}, along with 0.18, 0.72, 0.45, 0.16, 0.02, 48, 0.03 and cubicBezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1).
- Every element carrying initial/animate/exit or a MotionValue style is a motion.* tag, not a plain tag or a bare icon: motion.div for the sticky panel, each photo layer and the scroll cue, motion.span for the frame label, the caret carrier and every title word. CaretDown sits inside motion.span className="flex" and is never animated itself.
- Scroll from top to bottom: exactly one title is readable at any moment, never two overlapping, and the counter climbs 01 through 05, flipping at each cut's midpoint rather than at its start or its end.
- Watch the computed clip-path through a full wipe in devtools. It is always an inset() with four explicit percentages; if it ever reads none, a slot lost its % and that layer is unclipped.
- The four cuts arrive from different edges in order down, right, up, left, and each headline is pushed WITH its own wipe: down enters from above, right enters from the left, up from below, left from the right. The frame lands first and the type finishes a beat later.
- Paste it into a page whose body has overflow-x: hidden, then into an app shell that scrolls an inner div. The sequence runs in both, and the scroll cue and counter stay inside the visible area in both.
- With prefers-reduced-motion set: every wipe snaps at its midpoint with no intermediate state, no title slides or changes tracking, the caret does not bounce, and the scroll cue still fades out by 0.03 progress.`,
