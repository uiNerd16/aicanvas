# Promotion Guide — Surfacing a Design-System Component on the Homepage

When a design-system component (something living under `design-systems/<system>/components/`) is good enough to feature on the main AI Canvas homepage grid alongside the standalones, we **promote** it. Promotion does NOT mean "move" or "copy" — the DS source stays exactly where it is and remains the single source of truth. Instead, we create a thin **re-export wrapper** under `components-workspace/`, register the wrapper in the registry, screenshot it, and treat it like any other standalone from that point on.

This guide documents the full workflow using the first real promotion — `andromeda-button` — as the worked example. Everything below is taken from that wrapper's actual code. When new promotions surface new patterns, extend this file.

## The folder shape

```
components-workspace/andromeda-button/
  index.tsx      ← re-exports Button from design-systems/andromeda/components/Button
                    and renders it inside a preview-friendly container
  prompts.ts     ← prompts written as if the reader has never heard of Andromeda
  spec.md        ← the brief that justified the promotion
```

## Naming convention

Prefix the wrapper folder with the DS name: `andromeda-button`, `andromeda-card`, `meridian-stat-tile`, `meridian-input`, etc. This:

- Makes the relationship obvious in the folder list
- Prevents name collisions with pure standalones (e.g. if someone builds a non-DS `button` experiment later)
- Gives the homepage card a unique slug — `/components/andromeda-button` reads clearly as "the Andromeda design system's Button"

The wrapper's exported function matches the folder in PascalCase: `andromeda-button/` → `export function AndromedaButton()`.

## Pattern 1 — Boundary retyping for untyped DS code

**This is the pattern that makes promotion work at all.** The rest of the guide depends on understanding it.

All `design-systems/*/components/*.tsx` files have a `// @ts-nocheck` header (see `design-systems/CLAUDE.md` for why). When a strict-TypeScript file like a standalone wrapper imports from them, TypeScript's type inference runs on the untyped `forwardRef(function(...))` signature and resolves it to `ForwardRefExoticComponent<RefAttributes<unknown>>` — no `children`, no `variant`, no `size`, no anything. Any attempt to use the imported component with props throws `TS2322` / `TS7031` errors immediately.

The fix: **cast at the import boundary.** Define a minimal structural type for the props you care about, import the raw component under a different name, and cast it once.

From `components-workspace/andromeda-button/index.tsx`:

```tsx
import type { ComponentType, ReactNode } from 'react'
import { Button as RawButton } from '../../design-systems/andromeda/components/Button'

// Andromeda Button has no explicit TS prop types — retype at the boundary.
type AndromedaButtonProps = {
  variant?: 'default' | 'outline' | 'ghost' | 'destructive' | 'link'
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg'
  icon?: ComponentType<{ size?: number }>
  children?: ReactNode
  className?: string
  onClick?: () => void
  disabled?: boolean
}
const Button = RawButton as unknown as ComponentType<AndromedaButtonProps>
```

Rules for writing the boundary type:

- **Only type the props you actually use in the wrapper.** Don't try to mirror the whole DS component's API — that's busywork, and it'll drift. The wrapper is a preview, not a general-purpose import surface.
- **Use `as unknown as ComponentType<...>`** — the double-cast is necessary because the raw exported type is incompatible with your narrower type, and TypeScript needs the `unknown` step to accept the conversion.
- **`icon` props that accept React components must be typed as `ComponentType<{ size?: number }>`** (or whatever props the icon receives) — not as `ReactNode`. Icons are components, not elements.
- **Name the raw import `RawButton` / `RawCard` / etc.** and re-alias to the clean name after the cast. That way the rest of the file reads like normal React code — `<Button variant="default">` not `<RawButton variant="default">`.

**This pattern will become unnecessary** once the DS gets a proper typing pass (the `@ts-nocheck` headers come off, real prop interfaces are added). Until then, every promotion wrapper does boundary retyping. Document any new prop shapes in this file as you add them.

## Pattern 2 — Replicate the DS showcase, don't reinvent the preview

The wrapper's job is to show the DS component **exactly as it appears on the DS's own overview page**. The user already spent effort designing the showcase layout (Variants / Sizes / With icon / Disabled rows for the Andromeda Button); the wrapper should reuse that layout one-to-one, not invent a different one.

For `andromeda-button`, this meant copying the `Row` helper from `app/design-systems/andromeda/showcase/page.tsx` and using it directly in the wrapper:

```tsx
function Row({ label, children }: { label: string; children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <div style={{ marginBottom: 20 }}>
      <div
        style={{
          marginBottom: 12,
          fontFamily: "var(--andromeda-font-mono, 'JetBrains Mono', monospace)",
          fontSize: 10,
          color: 'rgba(255,255,255,0.22)',
          textTransform: 'uppercase',
          letterSpacing: '0.22em',
        }}
      >
        {label}
      </div>
      <div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', gap: 12, alignItems: 'center' }}>
        {children}
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Then the wrapper renders the same rows the showcase does:

```tsx
<Row label="Variants">
  <Button variant="default">Default</Button>
  <Button variant="outline">Outline</Button>
  <Button variant="ghost">Ghost</Button>
  <Button variant="destructive">Destructive</Button>
  <Button variant="link">Link</Button>
</Row>
<Row label="Sizes">
  <Button size="sm">Small</Button>
  <Button size="md">Medium</Button>
  <Button size="lg">Large</Button>
</Row>
<Row label="With icon">
  <Button icon={Notification}>Notifications</Button>
  <Button variant="outline" icon={Settings}>Settings</Button>
  <Button variant="destructive" icon={Notification}>Abort</Button>
</Row>
<Row label="Disabled">
  <Button disabled>Default</Button>
  <Button variant="outline" disabled>Outline</Button>
  <Button variant="destructive" disabled>Destructive</Button>
</Row>
```

**Rules:**
- Inline the `Row` helper in the wrapper file. Don't extract to a shared helper — every DS has a different showcase style, and the row styling should match the source DS's own conventions.
- The wrapper may wrap into multiple lines on a 480×480 homepage card. That's expected and acceptable — `flexWrap: 'wrap'` in the row handles it. The detail page has more width and renders everything in straight rows.
- Match the sample labels to the showcase page exactly. If the showcase calls it "Notifications", don't change it to "Notify" in the wrapper.

## Pattern 3 — Dark-only design systems break container-chrome convention

Standalones normally render inside a `className="flex h-full w-full items-center justify-center bg-sand-100 dark:bg-sand-950"` container — the sand-100/sand-950 pair is the "container chrome" rule in `components-workspace/CLAUDE.md`.

**Promotion wrappers of intrinsically-dark design systems break this rule.** Andromeda is a sci-fi / blueprint system — transparent hairline surfaces on a near-black canvas. If you drop an Andromeda Button onto `sand-100` in light mode, the transparent surfaces render against a pale tan background and the aesthetic completely collapses.

The fix: **override the container background to match the DS's void color, in both themes.**

```tsx
<div
  className={'relative flex h-full w-full items-center justify-center ' + jetbrainsMono.variable}
  style={{ background: '#0E0E0F' }}
>
```

Precedent: existing dark-only standalones (`x-grid`, `grid-lines`, `dot-grid`) already do this — they set their own dark backgrounds regardless of site theme. Promotion wrappers of dark DSes are the same case.

**Per-DS background values** (document new ones here as systems are added):

| System   | Container background       | Why                                    |
|----------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Andromeda | `#0E0E0F` (void)          | DS tokens define this as `surface.void` — the canvas color every Andromeda example uses |
| Meridian  | TBD — first promotion of a Meridian component will fill this in |

If a future DS is **intrinsically light or neutral** and its components render correctly against `sand-100 dark:bg-sand-950`, then the standard container-chrome rule applies and no override is needed. This has not happened yet.

## Pattern 4 — Font variables must be loaded in the wrapper

DS components often reference fonts via CSS custom properties (`--andromeda-font-mono`, etc.) that are set by the DS token file. The variables resolve to a font stack that starts with a specific font (e.g. JetBrains Mono), and the DS expects the font to be loaded via `next/font/google` at route scope.

**The wrapper must load the font itself.** Without it, the CSS var falls back to the system monospace and the component looks wrong.

```tsx
'use client'
import { JetBrains_Mono } from 'next/font/google'

const jetbrainsMono = JetBrains_Mono({
  subsets: ['latin'],
  variable: '--font-jetbrains-mono',
  display: 'swap',
})

export function AndromedaButton() {
  return (
    <div className={'relative flex h-full w-full items-center justify-center ' + jetbrainsMono.variable}>
      ...
    </div>
  )
}
```

`next/font/google` works in client components (`'use client'`) as long as it's called at **module scope**, not inside the component body. The `.variable` className needs to be applied to an ancestor of the DS component so the CSS custom property cascades down to it.

If the DS uses a different font, swap the import:
- JetBrains Mono → `import { JetBrains_Mono } from 'next/font/google'` (Andromeda)
- Any other Google Font → `import { Font_Name } from 'next/font/google'` with matching `variable: '--font-font-name'`

## Writing the description

The registry entry's `description` field is **user-facing copy** that appears on the homepage card and the detail page header. It must describe **what the component is and does**, NOT that it's a promotion wrapper or that the source lives in a DS folder. Users don't care about the mechanism.

**Good** (from `andromeda-button`):

> A sci-fi / blueprint-aesthetic button with five variants (default, outline, ghost, destructive, link), three sizes (small, medium, large), optional leading icon, and full hover / focus / active / disabled state coverage. Transparent hairline surfaces sit on a near-black canvas, with an electric-blue accent that brightens and glows on interaction.

What makes it good: names the aesthetic ("sci-fi / blueprint"), lists the variants/sizes/states the viewer will see in the preview, describes the surface treatment and accent, mentions the interaction (hover glow). Reads like any other standalone description.

**Bad** (what NOT to write):

> Promotion wrapper for the Andromeda design system's Button. Re-exports from `design-systems/andromeda/components/Button.tsx`. Source of truth lives in the DS.

What's wrong: it talks about the mechanism, not the component. The reader doesn't care where the code lives or that it's a wrapper.

## Writing the prompts

Promoted components follow the **same 4-lane prompt contract** as standalones (`Claude`, `GPT`, `Gemini`, `V0`), but with a critical twist:

**The prompt must teach the reader how to rebuild the component from scratch in their own project — NOT how to import it from the design system.**

A reader who finds Andromeda Button on aicanvas.me and opens its drawer has never heard of Andromeda. They want a self-contained recipe they can paste into their project. The prompt must inline:

- All required dependencies (`@radix-ui/react-slot`, `class-variance-authority`, `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`)
- The full `cva` variants object with every variant's Tailwind classes
- The helper that emits the CSS custom properties (e.g. `andromedaVars()` renamed to `spaceVars()` or `tokens()` — whatever makes sense in prose)
- The exact token values the CSS vars resolve to (hex colors, rgba alpha values, spacing numbers)
- The structural classes applied to every variant
- The `forwardRef` signature with explicit prop types (the prompt audience is building fresh code, so they get the types the wrapper has to cast for)
- The `next/font/google` setup if a specific font is required
- An example usage showing 3–5 button variants rendered on the dark background

Do NOT write prompts that say "import from the Andromeda design system" or reference any file under `design-systems/`. The promoted component must be reproducible by someone who only has the prompt and the four libraries above.

**Lane-specific notes** (same as regular standalones, covered in `../skills/prompts-guide.md`): Claude = mid-density spec, GPT = highest density with exact constants, Gemini = defensive and explicit, V0 = natural language prose.

For the first promotion (`andromeda-button`), only the Claude lane was filled in as proof of mechanism. Future polished promotions should cover all four lanes — **but if the component is complex and the lanes would take a long session, start with Claude and flesh out the others later.** Partial prompts are fine; the drawer UI filters to lanes that have content.

## Full integration steps

Once the wrapper folder exists with `index.tsx`, `prompts.ts`, and `spec.md`, follow these steps to get the card on the homepage grid. This is the same flow as any standalone integration — the `integration/CLAUDE.md` file documents it, and promotion adds no special cases.

1. **Register imports** in `app/lib/component-registry.tsx`:
   ```tsx
   import { AndromedaButton } from '../../components-workspace/andromeda-button'
   import { prompts as andromedaButtonPrompts } from '../../components-workspace/andromeda-button/prompts'
   ```

2. **Add a code constant** that mirrors the wrapper source (for the detail page's code panel). Name it `<SLUG>_CODE` in uppercase snake case:
   ```tsx
   const ANDROMEDA_BUTTON_CODE = `...wrapper source as a template literal...`
   ```
   If the wrapper's source uses template literals with `${...}` interpolation, you must either escape them as `\${...}` inside the code string OR rewrite the wrapper to use string concatenation so the code string can be a clean copy-paste. The andromeda-button wrapper does the latter for exactly this reason.

3. **Append an entry** to the `COMPONENTS` array at the bottom of the registry:
   ```tsx
   {
     slug: 'andromeda-button',
     name: 'Andromeda Button',
     description: '…natural user-facing copy…',
     image: 'https://ik.imagekit.io/aitoolkit/andromeda-button.png',  // filled in after step 5
     tags: [
       { label: 'Buttons & Toggles', accent: true },
       { label: 'Design System', accent: true },
       { label: 'Andromeda' },
     ],
     PreviewComponent: AndromedaButton,
     code: ANDROMEDA_BUTTON_CODE,
     prompts: andromedaButtonPrompts,
   }
   ```
   **Always include a `Design System` tag and a tag with the DS name.** Users filtering by "Design System" should see all promoted components; users filtering by "Andromeda" should see only Andromeda promotions.

4. **Add the slug to `scripts/screenshot.mjs`** — append to `ALL_SLUGS`. If the component needs a hover or click to look right in the preview, add an `INTERACTIONS` entry too. For most DS components (buttons, cards, badges), no interaction is needed — the default render is the content.

5. **Run the screenshot**. Dev server must be running:
   ```bash
   npm run screenshot -- andromeda-button
   ```
   Copy the printed ImageKit URL and paste it into the registry entry's `image` field. The entry is not complete until the `image` field is a real ImageKit URL (not empty, not a placeholder).

6. **Verify with `npx tsc --noEmit`** — must be exit 0. Any type error here usually means the boundary retyping (Pattern 1) missed a prop you're using in the JSX.

7. **Smoke test in the browser**: open `http://localhost:3000/` and confirm the card appears at the end of the grid with the uploaded screenshot. Click into `http://localhost:3000/components/<slug>` and confirm the detail page renders the live component and shows the prompts drawer.

## Un-promotion

If a promoted component needs to be removed from the homepage (e.g., the DS is deprecated or the user decides it shouldn't be featured):

1. Remove the registry entry from `COMPONENTS[]`
2. Remove the two `import` lines at the top of the registry
3. Remove the `<SLUG>_CODE` constant
4. Remove the slug from `ALL_SLUGS` in `scripts/screenshot.mjs` (and any `INTERACTIONS` entry)
5. Delete the ImageKit file via the API (see `feedback_screenshot_cleanup` memory — use `scripts/screenshot.mjs`'s private key for auth)
6. Delete the `components-workspace/<wrapper-name>/` folder

The DS source at `design-systems/<system>/components/<Component>.tsx` is NEVER touched during un-promotion. It stays exactly as it was before the wrapper existed.

## Updating a promoted component

Two separate cases:

**Case A: the DS source changed.** If someone updates `design-systems/andromeda/components/Button.tsx` (new variant, adjusted tokens, different prop API), the wrapper automatically reflects the change because it re-exports from the source. **But the wrapper's boundary type might drift** — if a new variant was added to the DS but the wrapper's `AndromedaButtonProps.variant` union still lists only the old ones, TypeScript will flag new usages. Update the boundary type to match the new DS API.

The `code` string in the registry will also be out of date after a wrapper change. If the wrapper was updated (not just the DS source), re-copy the new wrapper source into the `<SLUG>_CODE` template literal.

**Case B: the wrapper itself needs tweaking.** Changing the preview layout, swapping background colors, updating sample labels. Edit the wrapper file, sync the `code` constant, re-run the screenshot, verify the new ImageKit URL (same filename overwrites the old one because the upload script sets `overwriteFile: true`), clear `.next/cache/images/` so localhost serves the fresh image, smoke test.

## When NOT to promote

Some DS components don't make sense as homepage cards. Don't promote them.

- **Layout-dependent components.** Andromeda's `CornerMarkers` is a decorative overlay that only reads correctly when it wraps an outer container in a real UI layout. On its own in a 480×480 card, it's just four disconnected brackets. Not worth promoting.
- **Composition-only components.** `CardHeader`, `CardContent`, `CardFooter` — these are sub-parts of `Card`. Promote `Card` (which includes them), not the sub-parts individually.
- **Data-dependent components.** Things that only look right when filled with real data (`StatTile` might qualify if the stat value is the interesting part). You can still promote them by hard-coding plausible sample data in the wrapper, but consider whether the hardcoded data tells a complete story on its own.
- **Dashboard-scale compositions.** Don't promote entire example dashboards (like Andromeda's `mission-control` or Meridian's `dashboard`). Those live under `examples/` and are showcased at the DS's own route — they're not standalone components.

## Worked example inventory

| DS component | Wrapper slug | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `andromeda/components/Button.tsx` | `andromeda-button` | ✅ Integrated | First promotion. Boundary retyping pattern originated here. `#0E0E0F` container override. Only Claude prompt lane filled. |

Extend this table as new components are promoted.
