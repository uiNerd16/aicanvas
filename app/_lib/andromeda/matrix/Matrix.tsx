           card in the row by default, so the moment one card reserved room for
           an open panel its row-mate grew with it, and the row-mate's body
           centred its content inside that new height: a trigger nobody clicked
           slid to the middle of its card. Nothing moved relative to its card,
           the card moved under it, which is why the answer is start on the
           grid and not a change to the body's own centering. Same rule the
           sibling system's .ds-showcase-grid carries.

           What it COSTS is the shared bottom edge: every card now ends where
           its own content ends, and the pinned-open rows LOSE that edge
           permanently and lose it by a lot, because one card carries a 155 or
           317 reserve its row-mate does not. Roughly 293px of it on
           date-range-picker's variants row 2, roughly 131px on the user-card,
           user-menu and panel-menu variant rows that hold one open panel, and
           the same 293 arriving on date-range-picker's row 1 the moment the
           Live calendar is opened. (user-menu's row 2 stays even by accident:
           Open up's top 155 and Align start's bottom 155 sum alike.)
           Everywhere else the gap is small: a caption line where a live demo
           sits beside a size ladder (slider, segmented-control), a panel
           beside a bare canvas (planet), a taller grid (heat-grid), an error
           message (input, textarea). A ragged row is this rule working, not a

           the same precedence trap the interaction-states rules describe for

        /* A HOVER/FOCUS overlay reserves its room PERMANENTLY, which is the
           whole difference from the three rules below, and why it comes FIRST:
           all four are (0,2,0) with !important, so source ORDER is what settles
           a body matching two of them, and the LARGER reserve has to win. A
           card holding a tooltip and a menu keeps the menu's 155. (The upward
           rule's unconditional bottom reset still takes a bottom tooltip's 33
           with it, the same one-sidedness its own comment flags.)

           Tooltip's bubble mounts on mouseenter OR focus, so a reserve keyed
           off the mounted [role="tooltip"] would appear under the pointer and
           the card would grow out from under it: a pointer in the top 9px of a
           30px trigger gets mouseleave, unmount, shrink, mouseenter, and the
           card oscillates. PERMANENCE is what stops that, not symmetry, so the
           room stays one-sided like every other reserve here. The direction
           comes from the WRAPPER, which Tooltip stamps at rest (its bubble
           cannot be asked, it does not exist yet) — so anything that wraps a
           child in Tooltip is served without touching this selector,
           DataTable's mobile info bubble included.

           TOOLTIP 33 = 25 + 8, the same shape as the sums below — bubble plus
           its spacing[2] 8px offset from the trigger:
             bubble = 2 x 1px border + 2 x spacing[1] 4 padding
                      + size.xs 10 x 1.5 line box                     = 25
           It REPLACES the body's spacing[6] 24px floor rather than dwarfing
           it, so a top or bottom card grows by exactly 9px.

           LEFT and RIGHT get nothing, on either axis. Vertically the bubble is
           centred on the trigger and 25 is inside the 30px control.md square,
           so it never reaches the body's padding. Horizontally it hangs off the
           trigger's own edge and reaches
             86 = 78 + 8, where
             bubble = 2 x 1px border + 2 x spacing[3] 12 padding
                      + "REFRESH", 7 glyphs x (10 x 0.6 advance +
                        tracking.wider 0.14em = 7.4), 51.8 rounded up = 78
           so 101 from the trigger's centre once its 15px half width is added.
           The body CENTRES its content, so padding would move the trigger and
           the card edge together and buy nothing; what has to hold is body
           width >= 202. The narrowest two-column body the pages produce is 183
           (768px viewport, 240px rail) with an overlay scrollbar, ~175 where
           the platform paints a classic 15px one, so the bubble DOES overhang,
           by 9.5 to 13px. That is harmless because of the case ORDER, not
           because it fits: Left lands in column 1 and Right in column 2, so
           each opens toward the preview panel's 48px padding and never across
           the 12px grid gap. Reorder the four cases and that stops being true.
           The remedy then is wide: true, which hands the spec a full-row card;
           a min-width here would only spill the body past its own card border,
           since the grid tracks are minmax(0, 1fr).

           That 0.6 is JetBrains Mono's advance width, a FONT metric like the
           1.5 line box below and just as much not an Andromeda token. The
           label is spec copy, so re-add 78 if it changes; 33 holds for any
           label that stays on one line. */

        /* An open dropdown is position:absolute, so nothing above it can grow
           to fit it — the card stayed short and the panel hung outside. Same
           mechanism the sibling system uses: :has() reserves the room only
           while a panel is actually mounted, so a closed case keeps its
           compact card and the card GROWS the moment the dropdown appears.

           The room is PADDING on the side the panel opens, never a min-height
           on the body. min-height goes inert the moment natural flow height
           passes it, and this body is flexWrap:'wrap': a size ladder of three
           220px user-cards wraps to two or three lines in a component-page
           column and already flows taller than any single-line reserve, so the
           TOP line's upward panel escaped anyway. Padding is ADDED to the flow
           height whatever the content does, so one number holds at one line or
           four, at any body width — and the sums below no longer depend on
           trigger height, caption height or wrap count at all.

           !important is required for the same reason as :target above, and now
           for exactly ONE property: the body writes PADDING inline, and inline
           beats any rule. These rules touch nothing else. They used to
           set align-items as well, on the theory that pinning the trigger to
           the reserved edge made the fit exact; it did the opposite (flex-start
           pins content AWAY from a bottom reserve, and flex-end threw away room
           on the shorter card of a mixed-height line). Containment never needed
           it: the panel hangs off its wrapper, and a wrapper's top can never
           sit above the body's content top nor its bottom below the content
           bottom, so the reserve holds under ANY alignment. The body keeps its
           own inline centering.

           The two numbers are ARITHMETIC — summed from tokens.ts and the
           explicit px each component states, never measured off a screen — so
           re-add them if a token or an item list moves. The dialog reserve is
           its PANEL plus the spacing[2] 8px trigger offset; the menu reserve's
           historical constraint is called out below. Both dwarf the body's own
           spacing[6] 24px padding, which is the floor they replace.
           Too tall is dead space; too short puts the panel outside the card.

           MENU 171 = 163 + 8, re-summed 2026-08-13 for the rows-follow-rung
           law: menu rows now ride tokens.control[size].height, and every
           pinned-open case pins md (the open cases are node cases — a
           laddered staticOpen case mounted one open panel per rung and they
           slid over one another). The tallest mounted [role="menu"] is
           UserMenuPanel at the longest list any case declares, 4 items + 1
           separator, in BOTH user-menu and user-card (PanelMenu portals, so
           its panel never adds to a mounted card):
             row   = control.md.height                                    = 34
             panel = 4 x 34 + sep (1 + 2 x spacing[1] 4)
                     + 2 x spacing[2] padding + 2 x 1px border            = 163
             offset= the panel's spacing[2] 8px gap from its trigger       =  8
           A case that ever pins lg re-sums to 195 (4 x 40 + 9 + 16 + 2 + 8).

           DIALOG 414 = 406 + 8. The only [role="dialog"] a case can mount is
           DateRangePicker's calendar (Drawer portals to <body>, where :has()
           cannot see it):
             panel = 2 x 1px border + 2 x spacing[3] 12 padding
                     + header 24 (the nav button box)
                     + weekday row (size.xs 10 x 1.5 + 2 x spacing[1] 4) 23
                     + day grid (6 rows x 32 + 5 x spacing[1] 4) 212
                     + 2 x spacing[3] 12 column gap                       = 309
                     + preset footer                                        97
                                                                          = 406
             footer= the panel's own spacing[3] 12 flex gap (the footer is
                     a FOURTH child of a column that gaps between children,
                     which is the term this sum first missed)
                     + 1px border-top + spacing[3] 12 padding-top
                     + 2 chip rows (2 x spacing[8] 32 + spacing[2] 8 gap) =  97
           The footer exists only when a case passes presets, and its height
           is a WRAP rather than a constant: the four presets the spec declares
           fold onto two rows at the card's width. A fifth preset, or a longer
           label, buys a third row and this number goes short again, which is
           why the sum is written out instead of measured.
           That 1.5 is the line-box factor, and its source is Tailwind
           preflight's html { line-height: 1.5 } — NOT an Andromeda token.
           Nothing in this chain sets one. */

        /* WHICH WAY the room goes. Padding-bottom is right only for a panel
           that opens down; one that opens up would paint over the card header
           with its room sitting unused underneath. So an upward panel MOVES
           the same 155 to the top and hands the bottom back to the body's own
           spacing[6] floor. The offset is inline, so CSS cannot read it — the
           panel states its direction and the room follows. Keyed off the
           mounted panel, so a menu opened by CLICKING flips the room too, not
           just a pinned case. Direction is the ONLY thing that picks the side,
           so no component needs a rule of its own: a case that passes no
           placement still gets the one its component defaults to, because the
           panel stamps the resolved value (UserCard opens up, UserMenu opens
           down). Only UserMenuPanel stamps it, so the menu number is the only
           one needed here. Must stay after the rules above: equal specificity,
           both !important, so source order decides.

           The bottom reset is UNCONDITIONAL, so a card holding an upward AND a
           downward panel at once would lose its downward room. No case declares
           both, and the coverage test fails the day one does — a tripwire is
           cheaper than machinery for a case that does not exist. */
