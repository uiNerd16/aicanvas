            your card and billing details. We and Paddle each act as independent

            component so we can recognise your account and unlock any Premium
            content you are entitled to. The token is tied to your identity, so we
            treat it as personal data. We process it to authenticate your installs
            and to keep installs secure against abuse. The lawful basis is Art. 6

            Premium subscription) and Art. 6 (1)(f) GDPR (our legitimate interest

            When you create an account we store your email address and a salted,

            store the Google account identifier and email returned by Google&apos;s

            While signed in, we record which components you save (saved
            components), which CLI install commands you copy (install history,
            including the package manager you used), and your interface
            preferences (preferred package manager, preferred AI platform). This
            data is private to you, protected by row-level security, and only

            When you take out a Premium subscription, payment is handled by our
            payment provider and Merchant of Record, Paddle (Section 5). You enter
            your card and billing details at Paddle&apos;s checkout; those details
            are held by Paddle under its own privacy policy, and we never receive
            or store your card number. From Paddle&apos;s notifications we store a
            small amount of subscription metadata on your account: your
            subscription status, the plan (monthly or yearly), the current renewal
            date, and the customer and subscription identifiers Paddle assigns. We
            use it to unlock your Premium access, show your current plan, and let
            you cancel. If you cancel through the cancellation form, we also
            process the details you submit there in order to end your subscription.

          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed text-sand-400">
            Our hosting provider Vercel records standard server logs containing IP
            address, user-agent string, and timestamp for each request. These
            logs are short-lived and used to detect abuse and operate the
            service. Vercel Web Analytics produces aggregated, cookieless traffic
            statistics. Visitors are identified only by a per-day hash of the
            request and the hash is discarded after 24 hours. No personal
            identifier is created and no cross-site tracking is possible.

            in, the command you copied carries your account API token so the pull
            unlocks any premium content you are entitled to. We do not count or
            log per-install activity for anonymous requests. Abuse is handled at
            signup instead, through email confirmation and a Cloudflare Turnstile
            challenge, so these registry paths read no account cookies and keep no
            per-install counters.
