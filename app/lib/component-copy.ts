The track lives in earthy sand colors, the icon swap is animated with Motion, and the spring settles cleanly without bounce artifacts. Because the moving glyph confirms the new state, it is a more reassuring choice for settings rows, onboarding choices, and consent-style forms where users want to be certain a switch flipped.',

The face transitions are Motion-driven so the morph reads as one continuous gesture rather than a swap. It is the right pick when a feature toggle is part of the brand voice rather than a quiet utility: onboarding flows, product tours, marketing demos, and empty-state CTAs.',
