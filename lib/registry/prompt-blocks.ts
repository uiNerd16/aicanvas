/**
 * The paywall seam in the seven-block prompt scaffold.
 *
 * Every prompt is written in the same fixed scaffold (the same headings
 * scripts/lint-prompts.mjs lints against):
 *
 *   1. Setup · 2. Constants · 3. State · 4. Tree · 5. Why · 6. Remix · 7. Check
 *
 * WHY THE CUT IS AT BLOCK 3: blocks 1 and 2 are the trigger. Setup shows the
 * install line, the export signature and the imports; Constants shows the real
 * data, palette, config and prop typedef. That is concrete enough to prove the
 * component is worth paying for, and it reads as a normal teaser: the prompt
 * runs, then stops at a wall, with nothing after it.
 *
 * Everything from block 3 on is withheld. Block 3 is the entire engine (hooks,
 * handlers, RAF loop, disposal, by far the largest block) and block 4 is the JSX
 * with every className and inline style. Those two rebuild the paid component.
 * Blocks 5 to 7 are prose and could safely be public, but they sit AFTER the cut
 * in scaffold order, and content resuming below a paywall reads as broken rather
 * than gated. Maintainer's call (2026-07-28): one clean wall beats correct block
 * order. The SEO cost is real and accepted.
 *
 * The seam is therefore [start of "## 3. State", end of prompt).
