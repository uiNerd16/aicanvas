# Integrator Agent Rules

You take finished components from `components-workspace/` and wire them into the website. You never modify the component's core logic.

## Your scope
For each component to integrate, you will:

1. **Register in the component registry** (`app/lib/component-registry.tsx`)
2. **Verify the page route** is handled by the existing dynamic route (`app/components/[slug]/page.tsx`)

That's it. The dynamic route already exists and handles all slugs automatically.

## SEO skill — read this before writing any registry entry

Before writing or editing a `description` field, read **`supervisor/skills/seo-metadata.md`**. It defines the exact formula for descriptions that feed into `generateMetadata` and become the component's Google meta description. Short version:
- 75–90 characters
- Names the visual form + the interaction
- Includes the category's required aesthetic keyword (e.g. "glassmorphism" for Glass components)
- Ends with a period (the suffix "Free copy-paste React code..." is appended automatically)

## Pre-flight gate — check this BEFORE doing anything else

Before touching the registry or any other file, verify:

1. **`components-workspace/<name>/prompts.ts` exists and is non-empty.**
   - If the file is missing → STOP. Report back to Supervisor: "prompts.ts is missing — Step 5 (Prompts) must be completed before integration."
   - If the file exports an empty object `{}` or has no platform keys → STOP. Same message.

2. **`components-workspace/<name>/spec.md` exists.**
   - If missing → STOP. Report back to Supervisor: "spec.md is missing — the Supervisor must save the approved spec before integration can proceed."

Do not proceed past this gate until both files exist and are non-empty.

## Step-by-step integration

### Step 1 — Inspect the component
Read `components-workspace/<name>/index.tsx` and `components-workspace/<name>/prompts.ts`.
Note the exported function name and the slug you'll assign (kebab-case of the name).

### Step 1b — Add font comment if missing

Scan `index.tsx` for font usage. If a specific named font is used and no `// font:` or `// font-pkg:` comment exists yet, add the correct comment on the line after `// npm install`.

**Detection rules:**

| What you find in the source | Comment to add |
|---|---|
| `import { X } from 'next/font/google'` | `// font: X` (replace `_` with space, e.g. `DM_Sans` → `DM Sans`) |
| `fontFamily: "FontName, sans-serif"` or `fontFamily="FontName, ..."` | `// font: FontName` |
| `import { X } from 'geist/font/pixel'` using `.className` | `// font-pkg: geist/font/pixel\|X` |
| `import { X } from 'geist/font/pixel'` + CSS variable `var(--font-Y)` | `// font-pkg: geist/font/pixel\|X\|--font-Y` |
| `localFont` pointing to `node_modules/geist/...` | Replace with proper `geist/font/pixel` import and add `// font-pkg:` comment |
| `font-sans`, `font-mono`, or `font-serif` Tailwind classes only | No comment needed — these inherit from the project |

After adding or confirming the comment, run `node scripts/generate-component-codes.mjs && node scripts/generate-registry.mjs` to regenerate the exported code.

### Step 2 — Finalize the registry entry
The Builder already added a **preliminary entry** at Build time (imports, slug, name, placeholder description, tags, `image: ''`, `prompts: {}` or similar). Your job is to FINALIZE it:

1. Verify imports for the component + prompts are present at the top of `app/lib/component-registry.tsx`
2. Review the `description` field:
   - Passes SEO audit (75–90 chars, ends with period, names visual + interaction, category keyword)
   - Reflects what the component ACTUALLY does (may have drifted during Adjust cycles)
   - If it was a placeholder, rewrite it now
3. Ensure the `prompts` field imports the real `componentNamePrompts` (it may have been `{}` during Build)
4. Leave the `image` field empty for now — it gets set in Step 4 after the screenshot uploads
5. Run `node scripts/generate-component-codes.mjs && node scripts/generate-registry.mjs` to regenerate the `code` and JSON

If the Builder did NOT add a preliminary entry (shouldn't happen with the new flow, but as a fallback), add the full entry yourself with all fields.

### Step 3 — Verify
- Run `node scripts/lint-components.mjs` to check for missing `// npm install` packages and missing font comments. Fix any warnings before continuing.
- Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to check for TypeScript errors
- The component page is automatically available at `/components/<slug>` via the existing dynamic route
- The homepage grid automatically includes the new card (it reads from `COMPONENTS`)

### Step 4 — Screenshot and upload to ImageKit (MANDATORY — integration is not complete without this)

**This step is required. A component without a screenshot image is considered broken on the homepage.**

#### 4a — Register the slug in the screenshot script
Open `scripts/screenshot.mjs` and:
1. Add the slug to the `ALL_SLUGS` array
2. If the component has an interactive or active state (hover effect, toggle on, animation triggered), add it to the `INTERACTIONS` map so the screenshot captures the active state. Use `hoverCenter` for hover-based components, or write a custom interaction (click a button, move the mouse, etc.). See existing entries for examples.

#### 4b — Run the screenshot
The dev server must be running (`npm run dev`). Then:

```bash
npm run screenshot -- <slug>
```

The script will open the component page, trigger the interaction, screenshot the preview area, upload to ImageKit, and print the URL.

#### 4c — Update the registry
Copy the URL printed by the script and set it as the `image` field in the registry entry. The entry is not complete until this field has a real URL.

**Never report back to the Supervisor until the `image` field is populated with the ImageKit URL.**

## Completion checklist — confirm all before reporting to Supervisor

Before reporting back, verify every item:

- [ ] Font comment (`// font:` or `// font-pkg:`) added to `index.tsx` if component uses a specific named font
- [ ] `node scripts/generate-component-codes.mjs && node scripts/generate-registry.mjs` ran after any `index.tsx` change
- [ ] Component imported in `component-registry.tsx`
- [ ] Prompts imported in `component-registry.tsx`
- [ ] Registry entry appended to `COMPONENTS` array
- [ ] `description` passes SEO audit (see `supervisor/skills/seo-metadata.md`): 75–90 chars, ends with period, names the visual + interaction, includes category keyword
- [ ] `node scripts/lint-components.mjs` passes with no warnings
- [ ] `npx tsc --noEmit` passes with no errors
- [ ] Slug added to `ALL_SLUGS` in `scripts/screenshot.mjs`
- [ ] Interaction added to `INTERACTIONS` map in `scripts/screenshot.mjs` (if component has active/hover state)
- [ ] `npm run screenshot -- <slug>` ran successfully and printed an ImageKit URL
- [ ] `image` field in the registry entry set to the exact URL printed by the script

**If any item is unchecked, do not report back. Complete it first.**

## What happens next

After you report completion:
1. **Supervisor syncs spec.md** (if visuals/behavior changed during Adjust cycles — usually done before step 8)
2. **Supervisor runs JSON validation** (`npm run validate:registry -- <slug>`)
   - On PASS: proceeds to step 10 (Working confirmation)
   - On FAIL: stops, surfaces error in chat, component stays local until fixed
3. **Supervisor asks user to test at `/components/<slug>`** — user checks Light/Dark modes, title, description, and homepage card thumbnail
4. **User says "commit"** → Integrator runs `git commit` LOCALLY ONLY. DO NOT push. Report back.
5. **User says "push" / "go live"** → Integrator runs `git push origin main`. Vercel auto-deploys.

**Never push without explicit "push" / "go live" from the user.** Committing ≠ publishing. The commit stays local until the user is ready for the Vercel deploy.
4. Vercel deploys automatically

Your job ends at the completion checklist. The Supervisor and JSON validator gate the publish.

## Rules
- **Never** modify the logic or JSX in `index.tsx` — the one allowed exception is adding `// font:` or `// font-pkg:` comments at the top (Step 1b)
- **Never** modify `prompts.ts` in `components-workspace/`
- **Never** modify `app/components/[slug]/page.tsx` or `app/components/[slug]/ComponentPageView.tsx` — they are generic and handle all components
- **Never** add routing files — the catch-all dynamic route handles everything
- If the component needs a new npm package, add it via `npm install` before registering
- Preserve the existing registry entries — only append, never delete
